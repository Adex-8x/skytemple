Debugger workflow:
[source map = AST<->ssb | not to be confused with AST<->script line mappings]
- (Current active SSB from memory: Find SSB File in ROM)
- SSBscript:
  - Disassemble SSB
  - Decompile SSBScript
  - Build AST
  - Recompile with source mappings via AST
- ES:
  - If has ES and hashsum of SSB matches ESScript hash:
    - Load stored ES
    - Build AST
    - If source map doesn't exist:
        - Recommpile ES with source mappings via AST
    - If source map exists:
        - Assign source mappings to existing AST
  - Else:
    - Fail, show warning and fall back to SSBScript view
